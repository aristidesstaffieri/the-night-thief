<h1>Main View</h1>
<hr/>
	<p>Just use the standard layout for an offcanvas page as documented in the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/offcanvas.html">foundation docs</a></p>
	<p>As long as you include mm.foundation.offcanvas it should simply work</p>

<ul style="list-style:none;">
	<li ng-repeat="awesomeThing in awesomeThings">{{awesomeThing}}</li>
</ul>
